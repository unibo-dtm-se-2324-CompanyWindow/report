## About the Exploitation of Generative AI in the Project

During the preparation of this work, the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as Gemini AI and ChatGPT, was limited exclusively to the **code implementation and finalization phase**. It is essential to emphasize that these tools were **not used** for the project's design, architecture, or requirements definition. All design choices, structure, and underlying logic are the result of the team’s work and collaboration.

AI was employed as a valuable coding assistant to optimize complex steps, overcome specific technical obstacles, and accelerate the development of software modules. The goal was to leverage AI’s capabilities to fill gaps in specific library knowledge or to generate a basic code structure to build upon, which was then carefully reviewed, modified, and manually integrated by the team.

After using these tools, the authors reviewed and edited the content as needed and take full responsibility for the content of the final report.



### Gloria

In my role within the project, I primarily worked on the sentiment analysis component. While I have foundational knowledge of Python, I was not an expert in building an application from scratch that handles sentiment analysis. AI was crucial in this phase, providing me with code examples and suggestions for using specific text analysis libraries. Starting from this reference point, I was able to consciously develop a critical part of the project, achieving a result that I would not have been able to accomplish in such a short time without this initial support.



### Francesco

With a computer science background, I used AI in a targeted and strategic manner. I primarily employed it to optimize or resolve complex issues that would have required considerable research and debugging time. AI helped me overcome roadblocks and find efficient solutions for some of the more intricate parts of the implementation. This allowed me to focus on the more critical and creative aspects of programming, knowing I could rely on a tool that would accelerate the more technical and laborious steps.



### Giuseppe

I used AI to tackle the challenge of web scraping and API interaction. Despite my familiarity with programming, developing a robust scraper and managing APIs for data collection require specific skills that I did not fully possess. AI provided me with code skeletons and best practices for interacting with web services, enabling me to concentrate on the scraping logic and its integration with the rest of the system. This approach allowed me to implement an essential part of the project efficiently and functionally.



## Data Scraping Disclaimer

The data collected for the sentiment analysis presented in this project was gathered using web scraping techniques from the websites **Glassdoor** and **Indeed**. This methodology allowed us to obtain a realistic dataset to test and validate our Natural Language Processing algorithms.

We recognize that the practice of web scraping exists in a complex ethical and legal area. While the reviews analyzed are publicly accessible information, automated extraction may not be fully aligned with the Terms of Service (ToS) of these platforms, which tend to limit the use of bots and spiders.

Our approach was guided by two fundamental principles:

- **Non-Commercial Purpose:** The data extraction and analysis were conducted for exclusively academic and research purposes. There is no intention to reuse the data for commercial purposes, harm the platforms' business models, or violate user privacy.  
- **Technical Responsibility:** Our scraping procedures were designed to be as non-invasive as possible. We implemented deliberate delays between requests to avoid overloading the source platforms' servers and identified our user-agent to ensure transparency.

### Data Integrity and Limitations

The collected data represents a snapshot of the reviews available at the time of scraping. We cannot guarantee their future accuracy, completeness, or permanence on the original sites. The sentiment analysis therefore reflects the content of this snapshot.

This project has an educational purpose, aimed at exploring software engineering and sentiment analysis techniques, with full awareness of the implications of our data collection method.
