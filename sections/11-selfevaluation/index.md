# Team-evaluation

The team worked effectively and cohesively throughout the project. The group's composition proved to be optimal, thanks to the diverse skills and knowledge that each member brought to the table. This allowed us to cover a wide range of technical and organizational competencies.
Despite the geographical distance and remote work setup, we managed to establish clear deadlines and meet them, demonstrating great flexibility. We successfully handled periods of heavy workload by pausing the project and then resuming it with renewed focus and effectiveness.
Organization was a key strength: we divided tasks equitably and held weekly, or monthly as needed, update meetings. This approach ensured gradual progress and unanimous action, keeping everyone aligned on goals and the status of the work.

# Self-evaluation

The project offered a unique opportunity for me to prove to myself that commitment and studying even highly technical topics are possible. Initially, I encountered several difficulties, particularly in learning how to use GitHub with Visual Studio Code and the terminal. I invested time in understanding these tools, tackling each challenge as a chance for growth, which allowed me to achieve a good final result.

I focused on maintaining clear timelines and assigned tasks, which I believe helped simplify the workflow and make it more efficient for everyone involved. As for my specific responsibilities, I was in charge of the sentiment analysis component, which was one of the three core parts of the project. This involved using generative AI to analyse and interpret the collected reviews. A direct experience with generative AI and its application in a practical context was a significant learning experience.

Working in a group environment with diverse backgrounds also allowed me to learn from the different perspectives and strengths of my teammates. This synergy was essential in addressing coordination challenges and ensuring that the various components of the system integrated cohesively. Through this project, I was able to solidify my skills in managing the team and deepen my understanding of the fundamental IT skills and processes involved, contributing decisively to the achievement of our goals.

My primary responsibility for this software engineering project was to develop the **data scraping module**. Specifically, my role involved retrieving review data from Glassdoor and Indeed for subsequent sentiment analysis. 

Initially, this task presented significant challenges. I began by researching various tutorials and implementing a basic scraper for Glassdoor. However, I consistently encountered issues where my scraper was detected and blocked as a bot. To mitigate this, I experimented with different strategies, such as increasing the delay between requests and using multiple free proxies. Unfortunately, the proxies were quickly blocked, and the delays alone weren't sufficient. This process was a valuable learning experience, as it highlighted the limitations of simple scraping techniques and the sophisticated anti-bot measures used by websites. 

Ultimately, I resolved this issue by implementing a paid API for data scraping. This was a crucial turning point, as it allowed me to successfully gather the necessary data without being blocked. This experience was instrumental in teaching me the importance and practical application of APIs in modern software development, particularly for accessing structured data reliably and at scale. 

Beyond the technical aspects of my role, this project has taught me a great deal about the broader principles of **software engineering**. I have gained a deeper understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from initial design and planning to implementation and problem-solving. Furthermore, working in a group environment has been highly educational, helping me navigate the challenges of collaboration, communication, and integrating different components of a larger system. I feel that I have grown significantly as a developer and a team member through this project.

Working on the CompanyWindow project was a great chance to put into practice what I had learned in my previous studies in computer science. I really enjoyed working with a team that had different backgrounds, this allowed me to approach the project from multiple perspectives and learn from others’ strengths. 

My role covered both backend and frontend. On the backend, I built a complete structure and learned how to manage APIs to connect different parts of the system. On the frontend, I deepened my understanding of technologies I had previously explored in personal projects, such as React, Vite, and Tailwind. AI was very heplful, especially in refining certain sections and assisting with debugging as the codebase grew. It also helped me focus on more creative aspects, suggesting alternative solutions and optimizations that improved the overall efficiency of the system. 

Writing the report and working across both layers of the application required me to align closely with my teammates, ensuring consistency in inputs, outputs, and overall structure. This coordination was essential and helped us deliver a cohesive final product. 

In terms of areas for improvement, I believe the user interface could be made more intuitive, and the backend could benefit from cleaner, more maintainable code. 

Overall, this project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m satisfied with the results we achieved as a team.
