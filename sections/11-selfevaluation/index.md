# Self-evaluation
**Gloria** 

This project allowed me to prove to myself that commitment and studying even highly technical topics is possible. I had initial difficulties learning how to use GitHub in Visual Studio Code and the terminal, but I was able to achieve a good result. This, combined with the constant support of the team, made the project's success possible. I believe my focus on maintaining clear timelines and assigned tasks helped to simplify the workflow, making it more efficient for everyone involved.

My primary responsibility for this software engineering project was to develop the **data scraping module**. Specifically, my role involved retrieving review data from Glassdoor and Indeed for subsequent sentiment analysis. 

Initially, this task presented significant challenges. I began by researching various tutorials and implementing a basic scraper for Glassdoor. However, I consistently encountered issues where my scraper was detected and blocked as a bot. To mitigate this, I experimented with different strategies, such as increasing the delay between requests and using multiple free proxies. Unfortunately, the proxies were quickly blocked, and the delays alone weren't sufficient. This process was a valuable learning experience, as it highlighted the limitations of simple scraping techniques and the sophisticated anti-bot measures used by websites. 

Ultimately, I resolved this issue by implementing a paid API for data scraping. This was a crucial turning point, as it allowed me to successfully gather the necessary data without being blocked. This experience was instrumental in teaching me the importance and practical application of APIs in modern software development, particularly for accessing structured data reliably and at scale. 

Beyond the technical aspects of my role, this project has taught me a great deal about the broader principles of **software engineering**. I have gained a deeper understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from initial design and planning to implementation and problem-solving. Furthermore, working in a group environment has been highly educational, helping me navigate the challenges of collaboration, communication, and integrating different components of a larger system. I feel that I have grown significantly as a developer and a team member through this project.

Working on the CompanyWindow project was a great chance to put into practice what I had learned in my previous studies in computer science. I really enjoyed working with a team that had different backgrounds, this allowed me to approach the project from multiple perspectives and learn from others’ strengths. 

My role covered both backend and frontend. On the backend, I built a complete structure and learned how to manage APIs to connect different parts of the system. On the frontend, I deepened my understanding of technologies I had previously explored in personal projects, such as React, Vite, and Tailwind. AI was very heplful, especially in refining certain sections and assisting with debugging as the codebase grew. It also helped me focus on more creative aspects, suggesting alternative solutions and optimizations that improved the overall efficiency of the system. 

Writing the report and working across both layers of the application required me to align closely with my teammates, ensuring consistency in inputs, outputs, and overall structure. This coordination was essential and helped us deliver a cohesive final product. 

In terms of areas for improvement, I believe the user interface could be made more intuitive, and the backend could benefit from cleaner, more maintainable code. 

Overall, this project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m satisfied with the results we achieved as a team.
