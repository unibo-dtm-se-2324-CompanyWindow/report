## Abstract

CompanyWindow is an application designed to provide companies with insight into how they are perceived by the outside world, with a particular focus on gathering the opinions of employees, both current and previous. In an era where sustainability is crucial - encompassing employee working conditions, environmental considerations and social commitment - transparency has become essential for businesses. The ability of individuals to easily access and understand a company's policies can have a significant impact on public interest and, as a result, the company's reputation.
CompanyWindow provides a valuable tool for companies by giving them a comprehensive overview of how they are perceived, allowing them to identify areas for improvement. The application primarily supports Human Resources (HR) departments in improving employer branding, while also helping prospective employees by providing genuine feedback from within the organisation. Using sentiment analysis, CompanyWindow reveals how a company is perceived through employee reviews sourced from platforms such as Glassdoor and Indeed.
