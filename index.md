## Abstract

CompanyWindow is an application designed to provide companies with insight into how they are perceived by the outside world, with a particular focus on gathering the opinions of employees, both current and previous. In an era where sustainability is crucial - encompassing employee working conditions, environmental considerations and social commitment - transparency has become essential for businesses. The ability of individuals to easily access and understand a company's policies can have a significant impact on public interest and, as a result, the company's reputation.
CompanyWindow provides a valuable tool for companies by giving them a comprehensive overview of how they are perceived, allowing them to identify areas for improvement. The application primarily supports Human Resources (HR) departments in improving employer branding, while also helping prospective employees by providing genuine feedback from within the organisation. Using sentiment analysis, CompanyWindow reveals how a company is perceived through employee reviews sourced from platforms such as Glassdoor and Indeed.

The application performs the following key functions: 

- Collect employee reviews: CompanyWindow uses web scraping techniques to collect reviews from multiple sources, including Glassdoor, Indeed and blogs, to create a diverse set of opinions about the company. 

- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining: The collected reviews are subjected to sentiment analysis to determine whether they reflect positive, negative or neutral sentiment. In addition, the application extracts specific opinions and experiences related to aspects such as interviews, employee satisfaction, salaries and tenure. 

- Data presentation via an API: CompanyWindow provides an API that provides access to the collected and analysed data. This API allows users to query sentiment analysis results and related information to gain a deeper understanding of how the company is perceived. 

In essence, CompanyWindow serves as a critical resource for companies seeking to improve their public image and maintain transparency, ultimately helping them to make informed decisions in line with modern sustainability and ethical standards.
